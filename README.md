# Overview

This was an academic project done as part of the Semester 2 Computer Organization and Digital Design Module. 
For the project a 4-bit Nanoprocessor was designed with the capabilites of carrying out basic arithmetic operations
and showing the output on a 7-Segment Display. It contains a 72-bit Program ROM and a 32-bit Register Bank. Other 
components such as Multiplexers, Program Counter, Instruction Decoder were built as well. Given below is a high 
level diagram of the Nanoprocessor.
